# College_Resource_Management
College resource management is a vital aspect of booking rooms/classrooms in a college for both teachers and students. The project aims to design an framework to easily manage (book, edit, view, delete) the bookings done by the teachers or students. Nowadays, college students generally find it very difficult to find vacant rooms in the college for any unofficial/official meets, tutorial rooms and exam halls etc. Through this project, we aim to ease that difficulty faced by students and teachers by providing a single method to book rooms. Staff and students will be able to search for and add a booking in available teaching or events rooms that will be suitable for their meetings and view information about the rooms. Room availability can be easily monitored and edited according to the needs of the students and staff of the college.
